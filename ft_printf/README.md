## 💡 About the project

> _The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments._

	This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
	information below) of the printf function.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`cc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

## 📋 Testing
